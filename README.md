---

## Dependencies ##

- Spring Boot Dev Tools
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL Driver

---

## Description ##

- In this course, you will learn about Transaction Management in general.
- Why Transaction Management is important in any application.
- We will start by setting up Java, Intellij, maven, postman and spring boot from spring initializer.
- We will first create entities with some fields then we will create the controller, repository layer along with the service.
- Then we will go ahead and implement Transaction in our application.
- You will learn to implement Transaction Management in your project
- You will learn various strategies around Transaction rollback
- You will learn about Transaction Isolation
- You will learn about Transaction propagation, will also create different entity classes and different data transfer objects, entity classes will help us save and retrieve the data in/from database.
- Similarly the data transfer objects will help us take data from service layer and convert it to repository and vice versa.
- We will also create repository layer to perform operations on database using spring data jpa.
- We will also create a simulator which will act as payment gateway for us.
- Then we will create controller class where will annotate with different annotations to expose REST API endpoints which we can test using Postman tool.
- We will first test te application without Transaction management implemented, later on we will go ahead and implement transaction management and its different rollback strategies.
- Finally we will test the application again through Postman to test our transactional and rollback scenarios.d
- At the end we will cover some important points that one must keep in mind while implementing transaction management using spring boot.
